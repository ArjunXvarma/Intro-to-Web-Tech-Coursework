                        <p>As with previous games in the series, Odyssey features a narrative set in the modern-day, which 
                        follows Layla Hassan, an Assassin and former Abstergo researcher who was introduced in Origins. 
                        Assisted by fellow Assassins Victoria Bibeau, Kiyoshi Takakura, and Alannah Ryan, Layla's goal is 
                        to find the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus and the lost city of Atlantis by using data processed by 
                        her portable Animus device. The device recounts a secret mythological history set during the 
                        Peloponnesian War, which was fought between the city-states of Greece. The game's historical plot 
                        is set in 431-422 BC, four centuries before the events of Assassin's Creed Origins and the creation 
                        of the Hidden Ones, the forerunners to the Brotherhood of Assassins.</p>
                        
                        <p>The game's main storyline follows the player character, the elder of two siblings known as the 
                        Eagle Bearer, a legendary mercenary with Ikaros as a constant companion. As a child, the Eagle Bearer 
                        was exiled from Spartan society after they attempted to stop a Spartan elder from throwing their 
                        younger, infant sibling from Mount Taygetos at the urging of the Pythia, who determined that the child, 
                        if allowed to live, would be responsible for the potential glory or downfall of Sparta. As punishment 
                        for inadvertently sending the Spartan elder falling to his death, they were cast down by their father 
                        Nikolaos, who was compelled to do so by the Spartan leadership. They survived the fall and ended up in 
                        the care of a con man named Markos, who is based in Kephallonia, where they work various odd jobs under 
                        his direction. As a wandering mercenary or misthios after coming of age, the Eagle Bearer has opportunities 
                        to fight for both the Delian League, led by Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. 
                        Besides the Eagle Bearer's attempts to reunite their fractured family, parallel quest lines deal 
                        with the destruction of the Cult of Kosmos, a malign secret organization spanning the Greek world; 
                        and the discovery of artifacts and monsters from Atlantean times.</p>
                            
                        <p>The game features a number of historical personages players can encounter and interact with, 
                        including Alkibiades, Aristophanes, Euripides, Democritus, Sokrates and many others. 
                        It also includes historical and mythical Greek locations such as the Agora of Athens, the statue 
                        of Zeus at Olympia, Lesbos, and Macedonia. The game features several creatures from Greek 
                        mythology, such as Medusa, the Cyclops, the Sphinx, and the Minotaur, depicted here as 
                        experiments of the Isu, the same race that created humanity and most of the artifacts 
                        encountered throughout the series.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Odyssey's story begins in 480 BC, where King Leonidas leads the Spartan army against a Persian 
                        charge during the Battle of Thermopylae. The skirmish is won, but Leonidas is informed by a 
                        captured enemy that the Persian army has learned of the mountain path and will surround the 
                        Spartans by morning. Nevertheless, Leonidas resolves to hold off the Persian advance. In 2018, 
                        Layla Hassan recovers Leonidas' spear and extracts from it the DNA of his grandchildren, Alexios 
                        and Kassandra, to be used for her Animus to find the location of the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus. 
                        Whichever sibling is selected by the player (and therefore, by Layla) is designated as the Eagle 
                        Bearer.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 431 BC, at the onset of the Peloponnesian War, the Eagle Bearer is hired by a mysterious 
                        merchant named Elpenor to assassinate the "Wolf of Sparta" in the polis of Megaris, and departs 
                        Kephallonia after befriending a naval captain named Barnabas and assuming command of his ship, 
                        the Adrestia. In Megaris, the Eagle Bearer learns that the "Wolf of Sparta" is in fact the 
                        sobriquet of Nikolaos; that Nikolaos is not in fact their biological father and has another 
                        adopted son, Stentor; and that their mother Myrinne left Nikolaos and Sparta shortly after the 
                        incident at Mount Taygetos. The Eagle Bearer travels to Phokis to confront Elpenor, who reveals 
                        himself to be a member of the Cult of Kosmos and is aware of their lineage as the grandchild of 
                        Leonidas. Disguised with Elpenor's mask and robes after killing him, the Eagle Bearer infiltrates 
                        a secret Cult meeting in Delphi where they discover the Cult is targeting their family and that 
                        their younger sibling had survived the fall from Mount Taygetos, but has been manipulated by the 
                        Cult into becoming their champion known as Deimos. Accompanied by Barnabas and Herodotos, the Eagle 
                        Bearer embarks on an extended journey across the Greek world and eventually reunites with Myrinne, 
                        who had assumed the alias of Phoenix as the oligarch of the polis of Naxos. Myrinne persuades her 
                        eldest child to convince the Spartan regime to reinstate their citizenship and ancestral estate, and 
                        they continue undermining the Cult's activities in the Greek world together.</p>
                            
                        <p>The Eagle Bearer later encounters and fights Deimos at the Battle of Pylos, but is captured and 
                        taken to Athens, where the Cultist Kleon enjoys popularity as leader of the city-state following 
                        the death of his rival Perikles years prior. The Eagle Bearer escapes captivity and thwarts Kleon's 
                        plans with the help of their Athenian allies. The Eagle Bearer later joins Brasidas' Spartan forces 
                        in confronting Kleon's Athenian army at the Battle of Amphipolis, where the leaders of both armies 
                        die in battle, thus heralding the end of the first half of the Peloponnesian War. Afterwards, the 
                        Eagle Bearer returns with Myrinne to Mount Taygetos to confront Deimos. Depending on key decisions 
                        made by the player at predetermined points of the game's narrative, the Eagle Bearer either redeems 
                        or kills Deimos, and their actions also have a direct bearing on the fates of their extended family 
                        members and determines whether they will have a successful family reunion for the main plotline's 
                        epilogue.</p>    
                               
                        <p>After eliminating the Cult, the Eagle Bearer returns to their sanctuary in Delphi, where they 
                        find the Cult's pyramid-shaped artifact and Aspasia, who reveals herself to be the Cult's original 
                        leader. Disgusted by what the Cult had become under Deimos' influence, Aspasia secretly helped the 
                        Eagle Bearer dismantle it so that its original ideals of peace through order may survive. After touching 
                        the artifact and receiving visions of future conflicts, the Eagle Bearer destroys it and decides 
                        Aspasia's fate. At some point during their lifetime, the Eagle Bearer also meets their biological 
                        father Pythagoras, who is revealed to be a descendant of the Isu like Myrinne and Leonidas, and 
                        inherits the Staff of Hermes from Pythagoras to safeguard the secrets of Atlantis, gaining biological 
                        immortality in the process.</p> 
                        
                        <p>In the present, Layla encounters the Eagle Bearer in Atlantis, who warns her that the world 
                        needs balance between the Assassins' and Templars' ideals; either side prevailing over the 
                        other will result in the world's doom. Layla also learns that she is the prophesied one who 
                        will bring balance between the concepts of chaos and order. The Eagle Bearer gives Layla the 
                        Staff before passing away.</p>
