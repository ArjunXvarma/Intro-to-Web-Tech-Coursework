                        <br>
                        <p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game played from a third-person 
                        perspective. At the beginning of the game, the player can select to play as either Alexios 
                        or Kassandra, Greek mercenaries and descendants of the Spartan king Leonidas I. In addition 
                        to completing the story campaign, players can freely explore a large open world set in Greece on 
                        foot or on horseback. As the player explores the world, they will encounter various non-playable 
                        characters (NPCs) who give players side missions to complete. They also discover locations of 
                        interests, clear out fortresses and camps, explore tombs and shipwrecks, and collect hidden treasures. 
                        Synchronization points in various landmarks in Greece, which serve as fast travel points, can also be 
                        unlocked. Players can also collect various crafting resources, such as iron ore, wood, leather, metal, 
                        and precious gems, through exploration and hunting wildlife. Other side activities players can 
                        undertake include competing in a gladiatorial arena and completing time-limited bounties and contracts. 
                        Unlike the previous games in the series, Odyssey offers two modes of gameplay: Guided mode shows the 
                        player the locations of their objects immediately using waypoints, while Exploration mode tasks players 
                        to find out the locations themselves after being given brief clues from other NPCs.

                        <p>the main campaign missions follow the mercenary as they reunite their family and stop the Cult 
                        of Kosmos, additional questlines task the players to defeat mystical creatures from Atlantis and 
                        take down cultists. As the game is set during the Peloponnesian War, Athens and Sparta control various 
                        parts of Greece. An area can be weakened if the player assassinates the nation leader, defeats members 
                        of their army, burns down war supplies, or pillages their nation chests. When a region is weakened, 
                        players can join a conquest battle to aid either the attacking or the defending side. Winning a battle 
                        will earn the player valuable loots and gears. Joining the attacking team is a more challenging 
                        experience but it will offer more gameplay benefits. A bounty is placed on the player character if they 
                        commit a crime such as stealing or hurting an innocent bystander in public. NPCs called Mercenaries will 
                        then arrive to hunt the player character, who can either kill the mercenary, pay the bounty, or assassinate 
                        the character who place the bounty on them. Each area has a recommended level. The player may be 
                        easily overpowered if they venture into an area too early. However, the game's difficulty is scaled 
                        in accordance to the player's level. When interacting with other NPCs, players can select various 
                        dialogue options, including the option to develop a romantic relationship with some of them. 
                        At key moments of the game's campaign, players make crucial decisions which can affect the course 
                        of the story and lead to several different endings.</p>
